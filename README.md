# CS330-Assignment3
A project for my computer graphics programming class where we had to spawn balls by holding space bar which collide with the environment. Various blocks are in the scene. Some break after various amounts of hits and some increase the speed of balls that bounce off them. Balls change color and gain velocity when colliding with each other.
